- **List all commands:**
  ```bash
  travis help
  ```
  Lists all available commands and provides a brief description.

### **Advanced Techniques**

- **Using `.travis.yml` for Configurations:**
  Ensure your repository has a `.travis.yml` file for configuring builds. This YAML file specifies the build environment, language, and scripts to run.

- **Matrix Builds:**
  Configure matrix builds in `.travis.yml` to run tests across multiple environments. Example:
  ```yaml
  matrix:
    include:
      - os: linux
        dist: xenial
        language: python
        python: 3.6
      - os: osx
        language: python
        python: 3.7
  ```

- **Deployments:**
  Configure automatic deployments in `.travis.yml` to deploy to various services upon successful builds. Example:
  ```yaml
  deploy:
    provider: s3
    access_key_id: $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    secret_access_key: $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    bucket: my-bucket
    region: us-east-1
    local-dir: build/
  ```

- **Conditional Builds:**
  Use conditionals to run certain builds based on the branch or tags:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    include:
      - stage: test
        script: ./run_tests.sh
        if: branch = master
  ```

- **Custom Build Scripts:**
  Define custom build scripts for more complex workflows. Example:
  ```yaml
  script:
    - ./custom_script.sh
  ```

### **Summary**

This comprehensive list provides both basic and advanced commands for interacting with Travis CI using the `travis` CLI. It covers authentication, repository management, build management, configuration, notifications, user management, and advanced techniques for custom configurations and deployments.
